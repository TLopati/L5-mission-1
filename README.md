# 🚗 Mission 1 – Car Classifier AI Prototype

This project is a prototype solution developed for Turners Group, aiming to classify vehicle types (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck) using AI-powered image recognition. The project demonstrates how machine learning models hosted on cloud platforms can be integrated into a web application to support car insurance workflows.

---

## ✅ Project Overview

As part of the Full Stack Developer program, I built a cloud-based AI prototype that:
- Accepts an image of a vehicle from the user
- Uses Microsoft Azure's **Custom Vision API** to identify the vehicle type
- Returns the classification result (e.g. Sedan, SUV, Truck) to the frontend

This solution could support Turners Insurance by enabling automated premium estimation based on vehicle type.

## 📌 Tasks Completed

### 🧑‍💼 Task 1 – Identify Stakeholders

| Stakeholder            | Role / Importance                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turners Insurance Team | Project sponsor and primary beneficiary of the prototype     |
| End Users (Customers)  | Use the tool to get insurance quotes based on car images     |
| Dev Team               | Build and deploy the AI solution                             |
| Product Owner          | Define and prioritize features for prototype delivery        |
| Cloud Platform Provider| Hosts the AI model and provides prediction endpoints         |

### 📋 Task 2 – Understand Project Context

Five key questions I considered before starting:

1. **What problem am I solving?**  
   Identify car types to support insurance premium calculations.

2. **Who is the user?**  
   Everyday drivers uploading photos of their car.

3. **What are the technical requirements?**  
   Must use a cloud-based AI service (Azure, GCP, or AWS).

4. **What are the success criteria?**  
   Accurate classification with an easy-to-use UI.

5. **What are the project constraints?**  
   Use only free cloud credits; demo-ready by Show & Tell.

### 🛠️ Task 3 – Task Management (Jira)

Used **Jira** to create a Kanban board with 3 columns:
- `To Do` – Initial planning and setup
- `Doing` – Tasks in progress
- `Done` – Completed tasks

Each major task in this Mission was added as a separate card.

### 🧠 Task 4 – AI Prototype

- Chose **Microsoft Azure Custom Vision**
- Trained a classification model with labeled car images (sedan, SUV, truck)
- Integrated the model’s prediction API into a frontend app
- Deployed a basic user interface allowing image upload and result display

📁 Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend (optional): Node.js + Axios for API call
- Cloud: Azure Custom Vision (Free Tier)

---

### 🎤 Task 5 – Show & Tell

Prepared a 3-minute demo presentation that:
- Introduces stakeholders and project context
- Explains how the image recognition system works
- Shows a live demo classifying uploaded car images
- Reflects on what I learned during the Mission

### 📎 Task 6 – Submission Package

✔ Updated CV  
✔ LinkedIn and GitHub Profiles  
✔ AI Prototype with README  
✔ Presentation Slides  
✔ Jira Board Screenshot
